#### 1.How long did you spend on the test?
Answer: Almost 2 days.
  
#### 2.What would you add if you had more time?
Answer: - create types for products and basket items.- option to remove or edit the amount of one item in the basket;        - show to the user what promotion is available for each item; 

#### 3.How would you improve the product APIs that you had to consume?
Answer: Considering that the API wouldn't assume any rules implemented in the front, I think I would just add the promotion information directly to the '/product' endpoint to avoid multiple requests. Also include image URLs for the products.

#### 4.What did you find most difficult?
Answer: Treating the different rules of promotions and decide in which moment to apply them.
  
#### 5.How did you find the overall experience, any feedback for us?
Answer: I had a good time. The challenge is very market centered, and that's nice.It took me a while to realize that the API was being blocked by CORS. Maybe you could think of adding some headers to allow it.
