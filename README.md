# Checkout-system for local supermarket

I choose to make an UI with react using Next.js, because given the challenge, I thought it just made sense to have an interface.
I integrated the list of products and the basket to one single interface.


To run the app just clone the repository or download your zip

After downloading it run npm install to download all dependencies:
``` 
npm install
```

To run the project
``` 
npm run dev
```
or
``` 
yarn dev
```
To run the tests
``` 
npm run test 
```
or
``` 
yarn test
```
