# Checkout-system for local supermarket

I choose to make an UI with react using Next.js, because given the challenge, I thought it just made sense to have an interface.
I integrated the list of products and the basket to one single interface. 
After adding the desired items you will be able to see the price, possible discount and the payable amount.
If you want to change your products just click on [Clear basket].

The wiremock API must be up and running.
